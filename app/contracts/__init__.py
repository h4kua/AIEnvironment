Single source of truth for all flood-domain vocabulary.

Anything that needs to talk about SystemStatus, RiskLevel, Driver,
DecisionReason, DecisionAuthority, FailureSeverity MUST import from
``app.contracts.vocabulary`` — never define a parallel literal or enum
elsewhere. CI gate ``scripts/check_vocabulary_drift.py`` enforces this.
