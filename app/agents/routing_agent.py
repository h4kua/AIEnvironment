RoutingAgent — Stage 5 of the agentic flood decision pipeline.

Activates when:
  - origin + destination are both provided (always routes, regardless of risk level)
  - risk_level >= WARNING and no coords provided (returns flood advisory, no map route)

Google Maps provides path geometry only. All flood intelligence comes from the
internal pipeline signals via build_flood_zones. Google Maps has no awareness
of flood conditions.

TMA data fetch is always attempted (non-blocking). Failures degrade confidence
by _TMA_DEGRADED_PENALTY but never block routing.
