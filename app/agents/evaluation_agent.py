"""
EvaluationAgent — Stage 3 of the agentic flood decision pipeline.

Responsibility:
  - Apply failure-mode confidence penalties to the raw model confidence score
  - Apply a data-freshness penalty (tracked separately to avoid double-counting)
  - Determine system_status (OK / DEGRADED / CONFLICT / LOW_TRUST)
  - Optionally escalate risk_level when specific failures warrant it
  - Decide whether human review is required
  - Generate context-aware recommended actions

This stage synthesises ReasoningAgent output into a trust-weighted assessment.
It does not re-run the model or re-interpret signals.
